    <h1>Braden Coates</h1>
    <p>
      I am a student in the <a href="https://www.lakeheadgeorgian.ca/programs/computer-science/" target="_blank">Lakehead Georgian Computer Science</a> program.
      I am currently doing my first co-op remotely at OTP Design-Works where I am a software developer that makes cloud applications that integrate with the Zoho office suite.

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I first discovered my love of programming through video games in the 8th grade when I got a book a beginner c++ book that taught the reader to make basic console games, I eventually got into using GameMaker Studio and make a couple games, albeit not very good games.</p>
    
    <p>When I started highschool I also took an engineering course in my first year where I learned some visual basic, and how much I dislike it, and the basics of robotics using Vex IQ. I was also taught the importance of problem solving and how to go about it efficiently, which is probably one of the most useful things I've learned while in highschool. After School I started to attend meetings for the robotics team at my school, although I limited myself to really only being a helper and learning the basics of the team and the creative process.</p>
    
    <p>In my second year I started taking computer science classes, where I learned more Visual Basic even more in depth than before. I also took the next course in engineering where I learned more in depth robotics with Vex IQ and started interfacing with the computer using Visual Basic and the printer port. I was still apart of the robotics team after school doing more general tasks and learning what I could.</p>
    
    <p>Third year is when I really started exploring what I wanted to do for a career and decided on computer science over engineering due to my love of programming. I also started taking more responsibilities on the robotics team and started to do volunteering with the team for things like teaching kids a bit about vex and being a scorekeeper for Vex IQ. I also started learning python in my computer science class and some different development methods like agile and waterfall.</p>
    
    <p>My fourth year was more of the previous,except I also entered into my first hackathon, <a href="https://deltahacks5.devpost.com/">DeltaHacks V</a>, where I met up with three complete strangers to try to solve a real world issue in 24 hours. Sadly we didn't win the prize for the problem but we were able to secure best internet of things device at the hackathon. During my fourth year of highschool I was accepted into the Lakehead Georgian Computer Science program during the second year of it running and accepted it because it would give me both the practicality of going to college and the theory of going to university plus two co-op terms to learn how to program in a professional environment before I graduate.</p>

    <p>In my first year of highschool I met so many people who have the same passion for programming that I do which pushed me to want to pursue my own personal projects more than before and also attend <a href="https://deltahacks6.devpost.com/">DeltaHacks VI</a>, my second hackathon. But this time I went with just one of my friends, we went in with no knowledge of how to develope an app but in the end we were able to learn and develope a challenge winning app in just 24 hours.</p>

    <p>I am current in my first co-op term working for OTP Design-Works as a cloud software developer while also pursuing my own side projects such as the website you are on right now.</p>
