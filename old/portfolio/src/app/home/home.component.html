    <h1>What I'm Up To</h1>
    <p>
        I am a student in the <a href="https://www.lakeheadgeorgian.ca/programs/computer-science/" target="_blank">Lakehead
            Georgian Computer Science</a> program.
        I am currently doing my first co-op remotely at OTP Design-Works where I am a software developer that makes
        cloud applications that integrate with the Zoho office suite.</p>
    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I first discovered my love of programming through video games in the 8th grade when I got a book a beginner c++
        book that taught the reader to make basic console games, I eventually got into using GameMaker Studio and make a
        couple games, albeit not very good games.</p>

    <p>When I started highschool I also took an engineering course in my first year where I learned some visual basic,
        and how much I dislike it, and the basics of robotics using Vex IQ. I was also taught the importance of problem
        solving and how to go about it efficiently, which is probably one of the most useful things I've learned while in
        highschool. After School I started to attend meetings for the robotics team at my school, although I limited
        myself to really only being a helper and learning the basics of the team and the creative process.</p>

    <p>In my second year I started taking computer science classes, where I learned more Visual Basic even more in depth
        than before. I also took the next course in engineering where I learned more in depth robotics with Vex IQ and
        started interfacing with the computer using Visual Basic and the printer port. I was still apart of the robotics
        team after school doing more general tasks and learning what I could.</p>

    <p>Third year is when I really started exploring what I wanted to do for a career and decided on computer science
        over engineering due to my love of programming. I also started taking more responsibilities on the robotics team and
        started to do volunteering with the team for things like teaching kids a bit about vex and being a scorekeeper
        for Vex IQ. I also started learning python in my computer science class and some different development methods like
        agile and waterfall.</p>

    <p>My fourth year was more of the previous,except I also entered into my first hackathon, <a href="https://deltahacks5.devpost.com/" target="_blank">
            DeltaHacks V</a>, where I met up with three complete strangers to try to solve a real world issue in 24 hours.
        Sadly we didn't win the prize for the problem but we were able to secure best internet of things device at the hackathon.
        During my fourth year of highschool I was accepted into the Lakehead Georgian Computer Science program during the second year of it running
        and accepted it because it would give me both the practicality of going to college and the theory of going to university
        plus two co-op terms to learn how to program in a professional environment before I graduate.</p>

    <p>In my first year of highschool I met so many people who have the same passion for programming that I do which
        pushed me to want to pursue my own personal projects more than before and also attend <a href="https://deltahacks6.devpost.com/" target="_blank">
            DeltaHacks VI</a>, my second hackathon. But this time I went with just one of my friends, we went in with no knowledge of how
        to develope an app but in the end we were able to learn and develope a challenge winning app in just 24 hours.</p>
